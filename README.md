# renderX

renderX: A 3D c# rendering API

renderX is a non dependant c# Rendering API capable of 3d rendering without the use of openGL or directX.

More Features Will Be Added Soon, such as: shadows, performance increases and etc.

This project was made after I wanted to make a 3D CAD program however I wanted just to use Bitmaps.
