# renderX

renderX: A 3D C# rendering API

renderX is a non dependant c# Rendering API capable of 3d rendering without the use of openGL or directX.

More Features Will Be Added Soon, such as: 
  - Raytracing
  - Shadows
  - Textures
  - Performance Fixes

This project was made after I wanted to make a 3D CAD program however I didn't want to use any other API's.

Usage:

The renderProcessor is initialized
  renderX renderProcessor = new renderX(displayWidth, displayHeight, fov); 
  
  
 Â objectX data = 


renderX Also includes a importer which allows you to import 3D objects.
